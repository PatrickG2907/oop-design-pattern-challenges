# OOP Design Pattern Challenges (Python) 🧠🐍

Welcome to the **OOP Design Pattern Challenges** repository! 🚀  
This repo contains a collection of self-designed challenges aimed at practicing and mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design patterns using **Python**.

The focus is on **design and architecture**, not just implementing textbook definitions. Each challenge encourages clean abstractions, extensibility, and idiomatic Python solutions ✨

## Overview 🔍
Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring software design problems. This repository groups challenges into the three classic categories:

- **Creational Patterns** 🏗️ – Object creation and lifecycle management  
- **Structural Patterns** 🧩 – Object composition and relationships  
- **Behavioral Patterns** 🔄 – Communication and responsibility between objects  

All challenges are designed and implemented with **Python’s OOP features** in mind, including:
- Abstract base classes (`abc`)
- Composition over inheritance
- Duck typing and polymorphism
- Dependency inversion

Each challenge typically includes:
- A **problem statement** 📝
- **Requirements and constraints**
- The **target design pattern(s)** 🎯
- Optional **extensions** to explore trade-offs and refactoring

## Patterns Covered 🧠

### Creational Patterns 🏗️
- **Singleton** – Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global access point.
- **Factory Method** – Define an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses to decide the implementation.
- **Abstract Factory** – Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
- **Builder** – Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Prototype** – Create new objects by cloning existing ones.

### Structural Patterns 🧩
- **Adapter** – Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- **Decorator** – Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Facade** – Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Proxy** – Control access to another object.
- **Composite** – Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Bridge** – Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so they can vary independently.
- **Flyweight** – Use sharing to efficiently support a large number of fine-grained objects.

### Behavioral Patterns 🔄
- **Observer** – Define a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- **Strategy** – Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
- **Command** – Encapsulate a request as an object.
- **Iterator** – Provide sequential access to elements of a collection.
- **State** – Allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Template Method** – Define the skeleton of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to override specific steps.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Language:** Python 3.x 🐍
- **Style:** Object-Oriented Design
- **Focus:** Readability, extensibility, and clean architecture

No external frameworks are required unless explicitly stated in a challenge.

## How to Use 🚦
1. Navigate to a pattern category (`creational`, `structural`, `behavioral`).
2. Read the challenge description 📖
3. Implement a solution in **Python** 🧑‍💻
4. Refactor and experiment with alternative designs 🔁
5. Extend the challenge with new requirements if you’re feeling brave 😄

These challenges are intentionally open-ended—there is no single “correct” solution.

## Contributing 🤝
